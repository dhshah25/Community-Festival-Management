Community Festival Management System 
====================================

Overview:
---------
This project implements a PostgreSQL-based system to manage local cultural festivals â€” covering scheduling, registration, ticketing, artist management, and more.

Problem Statement
-----------------

Organizing local cultural festivals involves complex coordination of artists, events, venues, ticketing, volunteers, and sponsors. Many small to mid-size organizers still rely on spreadsheets to manage this information, leading to inconsistencies, scalability issues, and poor collaboration. As festivals grow in size and complexity, a more structured and efficient solution becomes necessary.

This project addresses that gap by introducing a robust, SQL-based database system to manage and streamline festival operations. With a focus on normalization, real-time insights, and data integrity, this system enables smoother planning, better reporting, and enhanced user experience for all stakeholders.

Directory Structure:

```plaintext

Schema Creation:

To create the database tables, run the following command in psql:

    \i ../pathToFolder/Database_Schema_Creation.sql

Data Insertion:
---------------
We use Python scripts with the Faker library to generate realistic synthetic data for each table. Each script outputs an SQL file (e.g., `insert_artist.sql`) that contains `INSERT INTO` statements.

To load data into PostgreSQL, run the following in pgAdmin PSQL Tool:

    \i ../pathToFolder/insert_artist.sql
    \i ../pathToFolder/insert_event.sql
    \i ../pathToFolder/insert_feedback.sql
    \i ../pathToFolder/insert_festival.sql
    \i ../pathToFolder/insert_participant.sql
    \i ../pathToFolder/insert_performance.sql
    \i ../pathToFolder/insert_registration.sql
    \i ../pathToFolder/insert_sponsor.sql
    \i ../pathToFolder/insert_ticket.sql
    \i ../pathToFolder/insert_venue.sql
    \i ../pathToFolder/insert_volunteer.sql

You do **not** need to use `load.sql` or CSV files â€” the `INSERT` SQL files generated by Python scripts serve that purpose.

Data Generation:
----------------
- We use the Python [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/) library to simulate real-world festival data.
- Each table has 3000 records.
- Scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory.
- Generated `.sql` files are placed in the `inserts/` directory.

Dashboard:
---------
Weâ€™ve created a dashboard to visualize key festival metrics using Power BI and hosted it on the web.

Sample Insights: <br>
 - Total Artists and Artists by Genre <br>
 - Top Revenue Generating Events <br>
 - Type of Registration in each event <br>
 - Total ticekts sold per month <br>

The dashboard enhances decision-making by giving organizers real-time festival performance metrics at a glance.

Dependencies:
-------------
- Python 3.9+
- Faker (`pip install faker`)
- PostgreSQL
